Hierarchical Clustering:
There are two types of hierarchical clustering is available.
  1. Agglomerative – it’s the bottom up approach
  2. Divisive – it’s the top down approach

Steps for Hierachical Clustering,
  1. Make each data point a single-point cluster -> tha forms N clusters
  2. Take the two closest data points and make them one cluster -> that forms N-1 clusters
  3. Take the two closest clusters and make them one cluster -> that forms N-2 clusters
  4. Repeat step 3 until there is only one cluster

Calculation the distance between two clusters:
Determining the distance between two clusters will actually affect the algorithm a lot.

Dendograms are used in separating the clusters in Hierarchical clustering.
