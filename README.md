# Clustering(Unsupervised)
Clustering is like classification, but the basis is different. In Clustering you don’t know what you are looking for, and you are trying to identify some segments or clusters in your data. When you use clustering algorithms on your dataset, unexpected things can suddenly pop up like structures, clusters, and groupings you would have never thought of otherwise. Basically, this is an unsupervised model where we don’t know what to predict unlike the normal supervised model.
To most common Clustering methods are as follows,
  1. K-Means Clustering
  2. Hierarchical Clustering
